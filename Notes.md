# Notes

Pretty raw form notes here.

### From conversations with Phil

what would be ideal, I think (this is a "thinking out loud" hint - not a requirement) is if you could emphasis the two sides to this: (1) your compiler is doing a fantasic job of do all the complex heavy lifting for you, so you don't need to worry about it (b) ... except when you do - for experts that know what they're doing and need to know what the compiler is doing, being aware is useful and tools like CE give great insights. Everyone should take a look under the lid from time to time.

I think the underlying theme I'm trying to promote is bringing everyone together - so diversity, but including experts and beginners alike. Cutting down any perceptions of elitism etc (which, other than some occasional exceptions, doesn't really exist in our community - but I think the perception of it does)

### Some examples

* from Das: https://godbolt.org/z/epsbII
* examples of clever compiler: https://gcc.godbolt.org/z/-bbUcl (via dascandy too I think)
* Hana's CTRE?
